[C]\nStill others consist of mixtures of rocky and metallic material and thus are called\nstony-iron meteorites. [D] Meteors come in all sizes, from small particles to the small\nplanets known as asteroids; no asteroid, however, has struck Earth during recorded\nhuman history. Many meteorites appear to be fragments of larger bodies that have\nundergone collisions and broken into pieces. Iron meteorites are fragments of the\ninteriors of these bodies, comparable to Earth's core, and stony meteorites are from\nouter portions of these bodies, comparable to Earth's mantle (the layer between the\ncore and outer crust).",

[C] These factors have given Japan its wealth of\nsedimentary basins, but they have also made mountainsides extremely susceptible\nto erosion and landslides and hence generally unsuitable for agricultural\nmanipulation. The island chain's mountainous backbone and great length from north\nto south produce climatic diversity that has contributed to regional differences. [D]",

[D] In Europe, during\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth century, the sitting time was sometimes decreased\nby focusing solely on the head and using professional drapery painters to finish the\npainting. For instance, Sir Peter Lily, the English artist, had a collection of poses in a\npattern book that enabled him to focus on the head and require fewer sittings from\nhis aristocratic patrons. Portrait painters could be asked to present the likeness of\nindividuals who were deceased. In this sort of instance, photographs or prints of the\nsubject could be reproduced. Theoretically, portraitis could work from impressions or\nmemories when creating a painting, but this is a rare occurrence according to\ndocumented records. Nonetheless, whether the work is based on model sittings,\ncopying a photograph or sketch, or using memory, the process of painting a portrait\nis closely linked with the implicit or explicit attendance of the model.",

In most large trees, the center of the canopy\ncontains only large branches, small branches and fine twigs are found only at the\ncanopy's edge. In the shaded center, the small branches that would once have\noccupied that space are long gone. Trees like the true cypresses regularly shed\nsmall twigs complete with leaves toward the end of summer. Most other trees shed\nonly branches that prove unproductive. If a branch is not producing enough\ncarbohydrate to cover its own running costs- i.e., it needs to be subsidized by other\nbranches because, for example, it is being shaded and receives little light- it will\nusually be got rid of. This prevents unproductive branches from being a drain on the\ntree and removes the wind drag (the force of air resistance) from useless branches.\n[A]\nBranches are shed for reasons other than lack of light. [B] In dry parts of the world, it\nis common for trees and shrubs to lose smaller branches to save water. [C] Small\nbranches have the thinnest bark (the protective outer covering of a tree) and greatest\nsurface area and thus are the source of most water loss once the leaves have been\nlost. [D] The creosote bush of United States deserts self-prunes, or removes parts of\nitself, in the face of extreme heat or drought, starting from the highest and most\nexposed twigs and working downward to bigger and bigger branches; it's a\ndesperate act because if the creosote bush loses too much wood, it dies.

[D] As an example,\nconsider the list of kings given by the Incas. As presented in the historical\nchronology, Spanish sources indicate there were thirteen kings who ruled\nsequentially. The names were given to them by Inca informants. However, one\nschool of thought in Inca studies suggests that the names were not actual people,\nbut, rather, titles filled by different individuals. Thus, the number of actual kings may\nhave been fewer, and several titles may have been filled at the same time. The early\nSpanish writers, being unfamiliar with such a system of titles, simply translated it into\nsomething they were familiar with (a succession of kings). Given that the Inca empire\nexpanded only during the time of the last four kings, or as a result of the actions of\nthe individuals in those four positions, this question is not deemed significant for an\nunderstanding of the Incas. But the example shows that biases and inaccuracies\nmay have been introduced inadvertently from the very beginning of the written\nSpanish reports about the Incas.

[A]\nSeveral of the lowland cities, such as Tikal, appear to have depended heavily on the\ncultivation of raised fields set in the marshy depressions known as bajos, which\ntoday flood intermittently in the rainy season but may originally have been permanent\nlakes. [B] The raised-field system of intensive cultivation (created by digging\nsurrounding canals and using the soil removed to elevate the fields for planting)\nallows year-round food production through the constant supply of soil nutrients that\nerode into the drainage ditches dug around the raised fields, nutrients that are then\ncollected and replaced. [C] Stable water levels were essential to this subsistence\nsystem, but evidence from Lake Chichancanab in Yucatan shows that between A.D\n800 and A.D 1000 this region suffered its driest period of climate in several thousand\nyears. [D] We may expect that as a result water level fell, and the raised fields in\nmany areas became unusable. But the human response must be viewed through the\nlens of the social, political, and cultural circumstances. These exerted a powerful\nmediating effect on the way the Maya endeavored to cope with their difficulties. Had\npopulation levels been lower, the impact of the drought may not have been\ncatastrophic, as it was, the Maya were already reaching the limits of the available\nsubsistence capacity, and Mayan elites had espoused certain social and political\nagendas (including expensive warfare and competition with each other). It was\nagainst this specific background that a period of drought led quickly to crisis and\ncollapse.",

[B] It\nhad been widely assumed that the inscriptions were exclusively of a calendrical\nnature or that they dealt with purely religious matters, notably the deeds of the gods.\n[C] But the inscriptions can now in many cases be interpreted as relating to real\nhistorical events, mainly the deeds of the Maya kings. [D] We can now also begin to\ndeduce the likely territories belonging to individual Maya centers. Maya history has\nthus taken on a new dimension.",
